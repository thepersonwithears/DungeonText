# DungeonText

A simple Python library for creating text-based adventure games. This library provides reusable classes for handling rooms, items, the player, and game logic. Itâ€™s designed to be easily extensible, so you can add custom game elements and interactions.


## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the main project folder (where `setup.py` is located). Then, install the library locally using:

```bash
pip install -e .

```

## Sample Code - Demonstrates all modules and functions!

```
from dungeontext_lib import Room, Item, Player, Game, Clear


# Create rooms
forest = Room("Forest", "A dense forest with towering trees.")
lake = Room("Lake", "A peaceful lake surrounded by tall trees.")

# Connect rooms
forest.connect("east", lake)
lake.connect("west", forest)

# Create items
sword = Item("sword", "A rusty old sword lies on the ground.")

# Adding items to rooms
forest.items.append(sword)

# Initialize player and gameo
player = Player(start_room=forest)
game = Game(player)

# Main loop
while True:
    command = input("> ")
    if command in ("quit", "exit"):
        Clear()
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    game.interpret(command)
```
